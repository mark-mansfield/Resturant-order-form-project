# Restaurant-order-form-project
A small javascript powered restaurant order form that i created as a first commercial project

The brief
the customer needed a form to sell a seasonal menu to their database.

I created a mailchimp account + marketing campaign and the form and backend to make the form and emailing needs work.
This was a quick project with super short deadline.

No css responsiveness was added



# STACK
JAVASCRIPT / PHP

High Level View
# Front end
1. load and parse json file from filesystem
2. render the data into the dom as a form
3. validate form field data
4. submit data to php 

# Back end
1. create order number
2. build csv file with column names and data
3. save file to server.
4. build a customer html email of the order
5. build an admin html email that extends the info of the customer email with the csv file as an attachment
6. send both emails
7. redirect user.

# Road Map
build this out into a framework powered client area and more elegantly coded front end
